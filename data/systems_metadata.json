Leveraging our recent MQM model, designated as Rubric-MQM, which mitigates the labeling bias inherent in Gemba-MQM while enhancing its precision in detection, we employ the Prompt Chaining workflow. Within this framework, we deploy three agents: the Translation Agent, the Post-edit Agent, and the Proofread Agent. The Translation Agent is responsible for generating the initial translation in accordance with the officially supplied prompt. The Post-edit Agent identifies errors in the translation and classifies them using the MQM framework with severities from 1 to 4. An important feature of our agent is that it effectively post-edits by proposing improved translations for each identified segment. The Proofread Agent, utilizing the post-edited translation, enhances the outcome by rephrasing it in five different versions while taking into account fluency and adequacy, ultimately selecting the optimal translation. We submit two versions for the unconstrained track: the first, derived from the Post-edit Agent, and the second, from the Proofread Agent. All results are obtained using the GPT-4o-mini (2024-07-18), which incurs lower costs compared to GPT-4o or o3, with a temperature setting of 1 and a maximum token limit of 1024. Our experimental findings indicate that the greatest improvement is observed when the Post-edit Agent is incorporated into the process, particularly when the initial translation quality is high.
